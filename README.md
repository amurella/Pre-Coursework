## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* Required: User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* Required: Settings page to change the default tip percentage.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* Optionals: UI animations for fading in the total and split values

- Additional: User can pick a background theme color
- Additional: Can split the check in multiple ways
- Additional: Displays the value of the default tip

## Notes

I struggled with first figuring out Xcode, but once I learned it, it was good. Figuring out the animations was slightly tough also.
